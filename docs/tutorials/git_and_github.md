# Git and Github Tutorial

Git is a helpful version control software.
We use GitHub to host our repository.
For background information such as (what is Git or GitHub?),
    please refer to
    ["About GitHub and Git" on GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git).

## Setting Things Up

If you never used Git and/or Github before,
    please follow this section to set things up.
To create a GitHub account, please follow
    ["Creating an account on GitHub"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).
After an account is created,
    please complete [this course](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
    (use the "Start course" button).
You should commit quite often
    (e.g. when a good stopping point is reached
    or taking a pause from coding).
When committing a change, please use a descriptive commit message.

## Recommended Workflow

All in-progress tasks should be in branches.
After a task or tasks are completed,
    they will be merged into the `main` branch via a pull request.
Pull requests allow collaborators to review the code
    (and changes to existing code) for correctness.
To learn more about pull requests,
    see [this course](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github).
When merging into the `main` branch,
    please use a descriptive commit message.
